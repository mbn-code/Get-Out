# Get Out - VR Co-op Escape Room

An immersive VR escape room experience built in Unity that requires communication and teamwork between two players - one in VR and one at a computer solving puzzles.

## ðŸŽ® About The Game

Get Out is a cooperative VR escape room game where players must work together to solve puzzles and escape a series of mysterious rooms. One player explores the environment in VR while the other player acts as a "Problem Solver" with access to crucial information needed to solve the puzzles.

### Key Features

- **Asymmetric Co-op Gameplay**: Unique roles for both VR Player and Problem Solver
- **Immersive VR Experience**: Full room-scale VR exploration and interaction
- **Advanced Scanning System**: Utilizes Lidar scanning technology for object detection
- **Multiple Unique Puzzles**: Each room presents different challenges requiring teamwork
- **Atmospheric Environment**: Dark and mysterious setting enhances immersion

## ðŸ§© Puzzle Rooms

### 1. The Wine Cellar
The first puzzle introduces players to a basement wine cellar filled with barrels, tables, and newspapers. Players must:
- Find and scan newspapers with specific patterns
- Communicate color and figure combinations
- Decode the correct combination to unlock the door

### 2. The Police Badge Room
A narrow room containing a mysterious police badge puzzle:
- Examine the geometry and colors of the police badge
- Match badge characteristics with Problem Solver's information
- Enter the correct code on the keypad to proceed

### 3. The Tile Room
A larger challenge room featuring:
- Three boards with geometric patterns, colors, and numbers
- Checkered floor split into two sections
- Complex path-following puzzle based on matched patterns

## ðŸ›  Development Process & Methodology

### Double Diamond Design Process
The project followed the Double Diamond methodology to ensure a systematic approach to game development:

1. **Discover Phase**
- Researched player needs and puzzle mechanics
- Analyzed successful escape room and horror games
- Identified key elements: VR, co-op gameplay, horror atmosphere
- Initial brainstorming included concepts like:
  - Lidar Scanner mechanics
  - Horror entity integration
  - Map Guide Player system
  - Dark Room environments
  - Communication-based puzzles

2. **Define Phase**
- Focused on core game requirements
- Established target audience through player personas
- Developed key gameplay pillars:
  - Asymmetric co-op experience
  - Communication-driven gameplay
  - Atmospheric horror elements
  - Scanner-based exploration

### Project Management Tools

#### Hack N Plan Implementation
The project was managed through Hack N Plan with four main boards:

1. **Pre-Game**
- Initial ideation
- Scrum meeting implementation
- Project planning documentation

2. **Beta**
- Core feature development
- Initial puzzle implementation
- Playtesting phase

3. **Release**
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Final user testing
- Performance improvements

4. **Documentation**
- Technical documentation
- User guides
- Design documentation

### Development Insights

#### Theoretical Foundations
- **Gestalt Principles**: Applied laws of closure and similarity in puzzle design
- **Player Types**: Focused on Explorer and Achiever types (Bartle's Taxonomy)
- **Design Considerations**: 
  - Large, simple shapes for dark environment visibility
  - Gamified web interface for Problem Solver
  - Intuitive puzzle progression

#### Iterative Development
Regular user testing led to significant improvements:
- Maze complexity adjustments based on feedback
- Enhanced scanner mechanics
- Refined puzzle difficulty curves
- Improved communication tools

## ðŸŽ¯ Lessons Learned

- **Scope Management**: Project scope could have been smaller for better quality control
- **Time Management**: Need for better initial planning of puzzles and room layouts
- **Team Communication**: Scrum meetings proved effective for team coordination
- **Tool Utilization**: Hack N Plan was valuable for task management and assignment
- **Skill Distribution**: Early cross-training in tools like ProBuilder would be beneficial
